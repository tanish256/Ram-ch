                <p>The bulk of coffee beans supplied by CECOFA are natural Robusta coffee grown in the vicinity of the shores of Lake Victoria. The harvest is red ripe cherries, which are dried naturally under the sun. The dried coffee beans are subsequently hulled to CECOFA's coffee factory, where they are graded and exported.
                    CECOFA invests heavily in quality management, traceability and coffee farming sustainability programs with a quality control laboratory and trainings in GAPs.</p>
